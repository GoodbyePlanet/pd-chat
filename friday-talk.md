### PD Chat

Idea behind the chat, how I made it, lessons learned.

Before I start there is one disclamer, I am not an expert in AI, I bearly scrached the surface.
As I wanted to get into AI I built PD Chat and today I want to share my knowledge with you.

1. Idea

I like to do side projects, especially when I want to try something new. And I think that
the best way to learn something new is to get your hands dirty.
For I longer time I wanted to try this AI stuff, because everyone is talking about it, youtube
is floaded with videos about AI, all the big faces in tech industry and tech companies are realeasing their LLM,
so I thought it's time for me to try to understand what is this AI all about.

We all know about PD handbook that we have. It's quite big, and I'm not sure if anyone reads it, if you do let me
know is the chat of the zoom session. So I thought it would be cool if we have an AI powered chat that will
know the ProductDock context and that can quickly answer our questions. My idea was that if you as an employee
have any question about company you can go to PD Chat and quikly find the answer, and not spend your time on trying
to find answer in PD handbook. Pretty simple idea right?

2. How I started?

We all know about Chat GPT. If you don't you should leave this zoom session. :P I found out that Open AI company behind
Chat GPT have an API that anyone can use, so I wanted to try it out. I saw that they have this fine tunning thingy where
your can train the model with your data so that model knows the context and can answer anything in that context. I thought
this is the way and without too much thinking I started doing something.

What is fine tuning?
