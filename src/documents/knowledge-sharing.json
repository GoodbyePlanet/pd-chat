In  #friday-talks slack channel you can let the rest of the crew know the topic’s name and the date. Meetups - You will get full event management support for organizing meetups and tech talks. We will organize a meetup on our premises or on some other suitable place that the crowd finds acceptable. Workshops - In-house workshops continue to happen periodically. Make sure that you’re up to date with official Slack channels and your mail, since you’re going to be informed through those channels most of the time.
