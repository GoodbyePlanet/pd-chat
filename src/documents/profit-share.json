    "content": "The profit share model comes from the idea that all of us are responsible for the success of ProductDock and, as such, should share the rewards as well. With that in mind, the whole model is designed around team effort and results. Due to financial and legal constraints, the profit share model is calculated per country. In other words, the success and rewards are measured for each country separately. The model is designed as a retention and loyalty tool, so it is not awarded based on individual performance or KPIs but instead on achieving the shared goal of billable days. Individual performance is still addressed with individual salaries, and profit share is an addition to the complete compensation package of ProductDock. Each month, we calculate the average achieved billable days per country, and if the number is higher than the defined threshold, the profit share pool is increased for the appropriate amount. If, however, the number is lower than the threshold, the profit share pool is reduced to the appropriate amount. After six months, the sum of individual months is calculated, and the result is the ProfitShare payout. The payouts are planned twice per yearâ€”with the first payout being for the period from January to June and the second for months from July to December. There are 4 different grades for payout of half yearly profit share. Grades are based on the time spent in the company to value commitment. 1 year with the company. 2 years in the company. 3 years in the company. 4 years in the company. For the first 12 months, a new employee is not eligible for participating in profit share.",
