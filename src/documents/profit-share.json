  "content": " Profit share model comes from the idea that all of us are responsible for the success of productdock and, as such, should share the rewards as well. The success and rewards are measured for each country separately. The model is designed as a retention and loyalty tool, so it is awarded based on achieving the shared goal of billable days. Individual performance is still addressed with individual salaries, and profit share is an addition to the complete compensation package of productdock. Each month, we calculate the average achieved billable days per country, and if the number is higher than the defined threshold, the profit share pool is increased for the appropriate amount. If, however, the number is lower than the threshold, the profit share pool is reduced to the appropriate amount. The payouts are planned twice per yearâ€”with the first payout being for the period from January to June and the second for months from July to December. There are 4 different grades for a payout of a half-yearly profit share. Grades are based on the time spent in the company to value commitment: 1 year with the company, 2 years with the company, 3 years with the company and 4+ years with the company. If an employee is in the company for one year and half he/she will be in the first grade for profit share calculation. If an employee is in the company for two years and half he/she will be in the second grade for profit share calculation. If an employee is in the company for three years and half he/she will be in third grade for profit share calculation. If an employee is in the company for four years and half he/she will be in fourth grade for profit share calculation. For the first 12 months, a new employee is not eligible for participating in profit share. If you have more questions please contact your Unit Lead.",
