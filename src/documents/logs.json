  "content": "One of the most important and sometimes tricky things are subjects that consider time logging. Here are a few hints from our side. When using your vacation days at productdock, consider taking at least 2 weeks at once, after informing and discussing it with your teammates and Unit Lead. Align vacation days with the rest of the team, while taking into account your project timeline. There is a minimum quota of working days per month, which you should also consider while planning your days off. In Jira, we have tickets dedicated to logging different types of leaves: Sickness - Admin 4 ticket, Vacation - Admin 1 ticket, Improvement time Skill - Admin 7 ticket, Improvement time Social - Admin 5 ticket, Improvement time Project - Admin 6 ticket, and if you need to log your working day and you are not on the client's project, vacation, sick leave or improvement time, use Admin 2 ticket. Also, if you need to leave, for an hour or two, during working hours you can record it in the Absence calendar, just make sure your Unit lead gave you access to it.",
